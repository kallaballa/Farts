<p>This distribution of RtMidi contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>doc</code>:      RtMidi documentation (also online at http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/)</li>
<li><code>tests</code>:    example RtMidi programs</li>
</ul>
<p>On Unix systems, type <code>./configure</code> in the top level directory, then <code>make</code> in the <code>tests/</code> directory to compile the test programs.  In Windows, open the Visual C++ workspace file located in the <code>tests/</code> directory.</p>
<p>If you checked out the code from git, please run <code>./autogen.sh</code> before <code>./configure</code>.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>RtMidi is a set of C++ classes (<code>RtMidiIn</code>, <code>RtMidiOut</code>, and API specific classes) that provide a common API (Application Programming Interface) for realtime MIDI input/output across Linux (ALSA, JACK), Macintosh OS X (CoreMIDI, JACK), and Windows (Multimedia Library) operating systems.  RtMidi significantly simplifies the process of interacting with computer MIDI hardware and software.  It was designed with the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>object oriented C++ design</li>
<li>simple, common API across all supported platforms</li>
<li>only one header and one source file for easy inclusion in programming projects</li>
<li>MIDI device enumeration</li>
</ul>
<p>MIDI input and output functionality are separated into two classes, <code>RtMidiIn</code> and <code>RtMidiOut</code>.  Each class instance supports only a single MIDI connection.  RtMidi does not provide timing functionality (i.e., output messages are sent immediately).  Input messages are timestamped with delta times in seconds (via a <code>double</code> floating point type).  MIDI data is passed to the user as raw bytes using an <code>std::vector&amp;lt;unsigned char&amp;gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<p>In some cases, for example to use RtMidi with GS Synth, it may be necessary for your program to call <code>CoInitializeEx</code> and <code>CoUninitialize</code> on entry to and exit from the thread that uses RtMidi.</p>
